This directory contains the experimental results reported in Chapter 4 (Results) of the thesis.
The results are organized by asset (Bitcoin and Ethereum) and by forecast horizon (H = 1, 5, and 15 days).

For the specialized time-series models (Prophet, LSTM, and Prophet–LSTM), performance metrics are provided separately
for in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations.

For the Gemini large language model (LLM), only out-of-sample metrics are reported, as the model is evaluated in a
zero-shot setting without training or calibration on the dataset.
